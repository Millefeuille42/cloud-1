# cloud-1

This repo also includes a Vagrantfile for a Ansible workstation `cloud-1-workstation` 
having Ansible pre-installed and a vanilla Debian 12 server for local "development" (preventing the need to rent a cloud server). 
The workstation has it's hosts file pre-configured toaccess the local vm server with the `cloud-1` hostname.

Inventory must be appropriately set (from sample file), for both cloud and local vm deployement. Fill-in missing / irrelevant parameters for the cloud host.
